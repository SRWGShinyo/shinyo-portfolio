Two weeks ago, from **Friday, July the 15th** to **Sunday, July the 17th** was held the 2022 edition of the GMTK Jam.
More than **22.000 people** challenged it, with over **6165 games created** for the occasion. At onepoint, a team of experts and I decided to **tackle the experience** and create our own game ! Here is how it went.

## What is the GMTK Jam ?

The GMTK Jam is a game jam organised by **Mark Brown**, the creator of the [GMTK Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw), a channel dedicated to **game design and game development tips**. Each summer (almost...) he organizes one of the most important game jams ever. This edition actually assembled 22.000 people, with more than 6000 games created.<br>

During a game jam, people, solo or with a team, have to develop a game from scratch in a given time frame. For this GMTK 2022, we had **48 hours** to create a game from scratch.

## What is our game ?

With a team composed of **four developers, one designer and one game designer**, we decided to create a narrative game, in which the player would have to escort Alice, a geeky girl who snuck out of her home to go and buy the last limited edition of "Captain OP", her favorite hero, and has to come back **before her mother gets angry**. To gain some time, she choses to cut through the forest...but a **horde of enemies blocks her path**! She then has to use her fellow dices, to solve the problems.

We chose to give our game a **very 'comic' aesthetic**, with sharp frames and a beautiful style. The game is all nice, as the player has **to explore and get more dices**, which will allow them to solve the mathematical problems in front of them. The game in itself is a succession of **little maps with those problems**, and the player has to select the proper dices to play to optimize its chances to win.

## How did we do ?

Personally, I enjoyed the experience. I have been doing game jams for almost five years now, and I never ever felt so good in doing one. We were all perfectly in sync, the team was working well, the final game looks awesome. I learned a lot and had a blast!

As for the reviews, they were mostly very positives. The game was very well received, mostly for its aesthetics, and we had a lot of very good feedbacks, which allowed us to release a second version, bug free, of the game just after the jam finished.
We ranked up **158th over 6165**, which is a top **3%** of games! We are very proud of how it turned out, and we hope to do it again next year!
